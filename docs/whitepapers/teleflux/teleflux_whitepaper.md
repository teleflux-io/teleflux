  Teleflux is novel and disruptive telecommunication system oriented towards
  Ineternet of Things and Edge processing.
  It offers global decentralized connectivity and communication infrastructure and
  incentivized network edge computing resource sharing.

  The system is based on immutable distributed ledger, either permisonless or permission-based,
  and can be used in public or enterprise context.

  Teleflux brings the benefit of global, world-wide network, removing the need for data roaming
  and ensuring network security by leveraging blockchain cyptographic caracteristics.
  System is managed by a set of autonomous Smart Contracts which ensure fair distribution of rewards and network fees
  among the network operaters, lowering the CAPEX and OPEX drastically.
  
  Teleflux builds an abstractional overlay for building specialized industrial application and new
  generations of telecom networks and it the first telecom system of it's kind.

# Introduction
Teleflux is global and decentralized IoT telecommunication system and SW platform for enabling
IoT sensor and actuator connectivity and processing on the network edge.

It provides:

- Global LPWAN and other wireless coverage
- Billing system based on `ERC20` token
- IoT platfrom for device and application management
- Edge computing resource sharing platform
- Network security based on Ethereum blockchain with BFT consensus and immutability

Anyone will be able to participate in Teleflux system - either as a vendor, operator, application developer or user.
Participants might come and leave at any time, while blockchain network assures security,
resistance to malicious-acting nodes and monetary incentivisation for network maintainers.

Since everybody can become a network maintainer with monetary compensation,
involvement of high number of nodes will enable ultra-low-cost long-range wireless
network installation and maintenance, while assuring wireless coverage
that would be unbeatable by the competition.

This will lower the overall price of service and enable low-cost, high-quality,
no-roaming (global) IoT network for next generation of IoT sensors and other devices.

# System Architecture

Teleflux is based on Ethereum blockchain-connected architectural blocks, wich together form full-blown telecom system.
This system is capable to provide wide-coverage long-range low-power wireless connectivity and complete management features, alongside
with billing and payment via Ethereum blockchain using `ERC20`-compatible `FLX` token. The system will equally provide global and
decentralized edge computing platform and microservice marketplace for enabling monetization of geographically-dispersed
network edge HW access and specialized system application development.

Teleflux is a complex system, devided in several subsytems:
- dFlux - decentralized IoT platform SW
- dTS - decentralized telecom base station, edge gateway and connectivity system
- dEdge - decentralized edge computing platform

# FLX Token
FLX token is utility token of Teleflux system. It is used to assure fair and secure functioning of the system, as well as to enable token economy within the system.

Primary purpose of the token will be to fuel the system - it will be used to tokenize the value of digital assets (i.e. IoT connectivity, IoT cloud platform services and Edge cumputing resources) and facilitate their exchange.

IoT platform providers will use FLX token as a representation of value of their IoT platform SaaS services in the form of APIs. Gateway operators will use FLX token to represent the value of their IoT connectivity enablers. Solution vendors will buy IoT platform services and wireless connectivity in FLX token. Device owners will pay device subscription plans in FLX tokens.

# Teleflux Foundation
Teleflux Foundation, a non-for-profit association, will be formed to maintain and regulate system architecture, QoS and proper functionality.

Main role of Teleflux Foundation is to lead the Teleflux Gateway Certification Program, i.e. to issue and stamp proper certificates for accredited Gateway manufacturers. Gateway Certification Program guarantees that only certified gateways will be appear on the network. It also assures new gateway provisioning and onboarding by defining an Ethereum Smart Contract related to this `gateway_id`.

Teleflux Foundation Committee membership is publicly open to all holders of over 10k FLX tokens.

# Conclusion
Based on many reports[^arm], we can be sure of one thing: there is gold in the mountains of data. A way is needed to mine all this gold - a platform is needed to monetize all this data. Teleflux is a an enabler that will unlock this huge potential.

Teleflux builds global decentralized IoT telecom system based on blockchain, that is secure and scalable. It enables new token economy - FLX token will be used as an utility token of Teleflux system, and will be used to enable fair and secure functioning of the system as well to enable billing facilities.
